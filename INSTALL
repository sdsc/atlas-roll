This roll bundles the ATLAS math package.  To install, execute these
instructions on a Rocks development machine (e.g., a frontend), starting in
this directory:

% make
% rocks add roll *.iso
% rocks enable roll atlas
% cd /export/rocks/install
% rocks create distro
% rocks run roll atlas | bash

Note that the optimization techniques used by ATLAS dictate only installing
the package on systems with the same architecture and configuration as the
build machine.

In addition to the software itself, the roll installs ATLAS environment module
files in /opt/modulefiles/applications/.(compiler)/atlas.

This roll source supports building with different compilers.  By default, it
builds using the gnu compilers.  To build for a different configuration, use
the ROLLCOMPILER make variable, e.g.,

% make ROLLCOMPILER=intel

The build process currently supports the values "gnu", "intel", and "pgi" for
the ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".

This roll also supports the ROLLOPTS make variable.  If it contains 'avx',
options are passed to the compiler to produce AVX instructions.
